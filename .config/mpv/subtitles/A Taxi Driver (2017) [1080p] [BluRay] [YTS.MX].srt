00:03:05,975 --> 00:03:11,893
A TAXI DRIVER

12
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,350
Private Taxi

13
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,558
- Lift the state of emergency!
- Lift it! Lift it!

14
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,350
No more martial law!

15
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:19,433
No more! No more!

16
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,225
What, is it an accident?

17
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:28,600
Disperse, or we will act with force!

18
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,433
I repeat.

19
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:32,643
Disperse,

20
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,308
or we will act with force!

21
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,058
I wondered why today was so quiet.

22
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,600
Did they go to university to protest?

23
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,100
Enough is enough...

24
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,475
Spoiled bastards need to be
shipped off to Saudi Arabia.

25
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,725
Work themselves to death
in the burning desert,

26
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:19,683
then they'll realize, "Wow,
my country is great!"

27
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,433
How can you dash at my car?

28
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,268
If you jump out like that...

29
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,183
Run!

30
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:38,433
Hey, where are you going?

31
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,768
Hey, you!

32
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,183
Get back here!

33
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:42,518
- Stop!
- Taxi!

34
00:04:43,225 --> 00:04:44,225
Taxi!

35
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:47,808
That...

36
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:50,725
To the hospital, quickly!

37
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,558
Mister, please go faster.

38
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,558
The first baby takes a long time,
even after the water breaks.

39
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:05,058
My wife spent 12 hours
in the delivery room.

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,683
The first baby's always like that.

41
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,643
Hey, hey, hey...

42
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:13,975
No more martial law!

43
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,893
Don't tell me you're that close!

44
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:21,643
Oh, whatever.

45
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,893
Throw out the dictatorship
and bring in democracy!

46
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,058
We're here, honey.

47
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,933
My best driving ever!

48
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,475
This way.

49
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:46,850
Other taxi drivers won't
take pregnant women.

50
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:49,058
But I did, remembering my daughter's birth.

51
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,308
Thanks... Honey, where's my wallet?

52
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,558
You packed the damn bag!

53
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:56,893
Take another look, it must be there.

54
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:01,643
Sorry but I left my wallet behind.
Tomorrow, I promise...

55
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:03,518
You know how many times I heard that?

56
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,100
I could've bought a house
with all that taxi fare!

57
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:07,350
No, I promise...

58
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,183
There she goes again!

59
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,600
It's coming!

60
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:11,975
Hold on just a second!

61
00:06:12,683 --> 00:06:14,683
Here's my business card.

62
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,143
Call me tomorrow, I'll pay double!
So sorry!

63
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:20,933
Pay me double instead?

64
00:06:21,558 --> 00:06:23,893
Best of luck in there, okay?

65
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:25,475
Best of luck!

66
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:06,100
This is no place to play soccer.
Go play over there!

67
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:30,643
Did she go out?

68
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,475
Hey princess, sleeping already?

69
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:43,308
You should eat dinner.

70
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:47,308
Huh?

71
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,808
Who did this to you?

72
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,518
I fell down.

73
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,725
Sang-go, that brat!

74
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:01,683
It wasn't Sang-go! I really fell.

75
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,893
Are you gonna lie to your dad?

76
00:08:04,808 --> 00:08:06,808
Eun-jung! Should I hit you instead?

77
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:12,058
Ma'am! Sang-go!!

78
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:19,350
Ah, just the person I wanted to see.

79
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:23,018
What do you say about this?

80
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:26,850
How could she do this to our precious son?

81
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,683
But she also has...

82
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:32,143
Really, I've never seen
a girl as wild as Eun-jung!

83
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:35,225
You're too soft on her
'cause her mother died!

84
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,100
That's a bit...

85
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,143
And since you're here, one more thing!

86
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,143
I've held my tongue because
I know your situation.

87
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,933
But you owe me 100,000 won in rent!

88
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:50,018
I'm sorry. Ma'am, I'll...

89
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:53,600
You're 4 months late, at least
tell us when you'll pay!

90
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,808
100,000 won is a lot of money for us too.

91
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:01,225
Sang-go, you're sleepy!
Must have eaten too much.

92
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:07,018
I don't care what my husband
says, I've had it this time.

93
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:14,350
And discipline your daughter, will you?

94
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:16,933
Breaks my heart to see my son like this.

95
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:35,558
Oh, I'm hungry!

96
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,683
Bean sprout soup?

97
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:42,975
Hey, don't fold the backs of your shoes.

98
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,518
Not answering again.

99
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,768
Those shoes are too small. Dinner's ready.

100
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:53,308
Then ask me to buy you new ones!

101
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,643
Wow, tastes great.

102
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,893
You could get married tomorrow!

103
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,600
Sang-gu's mom brought that over.

104
00:10:13,143 --> 00:10:16,350
Right, I thought it was too salty.

105
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Lift your head.

106
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:41,975
Dad, do we have to move?

107
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:45,183
Yup, we're gonna buy Sang-gu's house.
After I get rich.

108
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,475
So don't worry and study hard.

109
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:48,975
Okay?

110
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,183
Ouch, it stings.

111
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,850
Then why don't you listen?

112
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:05,975
What did I say? Play nice
with him, don't fight.

113
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,350
But he started it!

114
00:11:08,518 --> 00:11:09,768
Just ignore him.

115
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:14,850
Learn to bear it. Life is
never going to be fair.

116
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,058
Want to go on a picnic this Wednesday?

117
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:24,768
No school on Buddha's Birthday.

118
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,475
You should work. More
customers on holidays.

119
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,933
Oh my, you're even worse than your mother.

120
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:38,975
Who do you take after, to be so sweet!

121
00:11:44,683 --> 00:11:48,433
Under the emergency decree
starting on May 18,

122
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:52,518
martial law is in force, all
political activity is banned,

123
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:55,600
the nation's universities
are temporarily closed,

124
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,725
and labor strikes are strictly forbidden.

125
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:02,558
The recent street
demonstrations by students...

126
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:06,558
So does this mean I'll
lose passengers again?

127
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:23,058
May 19, 1980 Press Center, Tokyo

128
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:42,725
Beer and sushi again?

129
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,058
Hey Peter, how was the parliament today?

130
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,225
Same as always, nothing different.

131
00:12:50,933 --> 00:12:54,433
This is Jürgen Hinzpeter
from ARD-nDR, Germany.

132
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,893
He's been living in Japan
for about 8 years.

133
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,600
It might be helpful to know him.

134
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:01,933
It's good to meet you,
Mr. Hinzpeter. David John, BBC.

135
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,518
Just call me Peter.

136
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,850
It's my first time in Japan.
Anything I should look out for?

137
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,768
It's comfortable.

138
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,268
That's tricky... as a journalist,

139
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:16,558
you shouldn't be in a place
that's too comfortable.

140
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Excuse me?

141
00:13:18,308 --> 00:13:21,350
Nothing. Where were you based before?

142
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:24,893
South Korea. It's very
tense over there now.

143
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,683
I heard their government
declared martial law.

144
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,018
It's always tense there.

145
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,433
I think it's much worse this time.

146
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,308
On top of the martial law,
several opposition leaders were arrested,

147
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,518
and the universities got locked down too.

148
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,933
What else have you heard?

149
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,201
I've been trying to contact
some people I know,

150
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,475
but it's... it's almost
impossible to get through.

151
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:45,768
Since when?

152
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,268
Since last night.

153
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,183
Seoul, Korea

154
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,100
I work for the Church.

155
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,393
I'm a missionary.

156
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:47,893
It's been a long time.

157
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:54,143
I need to get back soon.
Something doesn't feel right.

158
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,683
How bad is the situation?

159
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:58,558
It's been 3 days since the martial law.

160
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:00,725
Kim Dae-jung has been taken in,

161
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,600
and they've got Kim Young-sam
under house arrest.

162
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:17,100
Gwang-ju?

163
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:18,768
It's a city down south.

164
00:15:22,143 --> 00:15:25,768
And there's no article about Gwang-ju?
No coverage, nothing?

165
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,808
This is the local paper from Gwang-ju.

166
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,975
They censored the whole page?

167
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,600
What exactly happened over there?

168
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,768
No one knows.

169
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:48,475
We got word of the first casualty
at 3 AM on the 19th...

170
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:49,850
But now,

171
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,475
even the phone lines have been cut.

172
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,725
What about the foreign press?

173
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,643
Today is Kim Jae-kyu's trial.
They all went there.

174
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,350
But the government has eyes on them.

175
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,558
They can't move as they wish.

176
00:16:05,183 --> 00:16:06,475
You must be careful.

177
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:12,893
I should go to Gwang-ju, first...

178
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,725
By yourself?

179
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,018
But how will you get there?

180
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,975
For a guy so paranoid about his car,

181
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:30,183
how'd you break a mirror?

182
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:34,143
A worthless punk. He ran
off after busting my car.

183
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:36,393
Why be a student if you can't
be a decent human being?

184
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,558
All right. I'll only
charge 5,000 won, okay?

185
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
What? Just take 4,000.
I've had a rough day.

186
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:45,308
Have a heart, man! How can you be so cheap?

187
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:49,558
And get an inspection sometime.
The engine doesn't sound right.

188
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,058
An inspection? I inspect my car every day.

189
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,850
After 600,000 km, this
car is past retirement.

190
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:56,475
Easy on my car!

191
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,975
Try fixing it after it
breaks, it'll cost you more.

192
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,100
Don't give me bad luck!
I'm already pissed.

193
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,143
3,000 won, then.

194
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:06,018
That is so unfair! You
know how much parts cost?

195
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,600
- Throw this out?
- No way. I'll use it later.

196
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,475
Leave it.

197
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:14,268
Dammit!

198
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:27,600
Hey, what're you doing?

199
00:17:30,975 --> 00:17:33,350
God, you're pathetic.

200
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:35,475
Pathetic?

201
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,268
So, the kids fought again?

202
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:43,475
I gave Sang-go a good scolding.

203
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,183
Ma'am! Over here!

204
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,975
- What?
- Another portion for us.

205
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:50,183
No, I'm fine. Never mind!

206
00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:51,808
Why not? I said I'd pay.

207
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,643
Don't be silly, I'll pay.

208
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:54,893
What's the occasion?

209
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,808
Instead, lend me some money.

210
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,683
I figured. How much?

211
00:17:59,725 --> 00:18:02,808
100,000 won. From your private stash.

212
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,768
Hey! I gave it all to my sister
As a secret wedding gift.

213
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,018
But why so much? You
paid off all your debts.

214
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,393
It's not the rent, is it?

215
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:16,768
Bingo!

216
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,643
My god.

217
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:22,768
Only you would borrow from
your landlord to pay the rent.

218
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,650
Lend it to me before you
start saying things.

219
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:32,268
Ma'am! Give me anything quick!

220
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,183
What's the rush?

221
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:36,225
We need to play cards after lunch.

222
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:40,518
You guys play all you like.
I'm going to Kukdo Theater.

223
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:42,393
- Got a long distance.
- Where to?

224
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,975
Gwang-ju. We'll go now, and
be back before curfew.

225
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:49,433
Wow, you hit the jackpot. For how much?

226
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:51,225
100,000 won.

227
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:52,433
100,000 won?

228
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:55,518
What kind of idiot would
pay 100,000 for one day?

229
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,018
A foreigner idiot.

230
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,518
Oh, do you speak English?

231
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:02,308
Of course. I grew up near the U.S.
army base.

232
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,268
Damn, and foreigners pay tips!
If you add the tip...

233
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:09,558
You spent time abroad.
Couldn't you handle that?

234
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,393
I'm sorry! Enjoy your lunch.

235
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,183
Ma'am, discipline Sang-go, will you?
Who does he take after?

236
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,893
And he eats too much. Takes after his mom?

237
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,268
Wait till I get that money!
I'll teach that kid some manners!

238
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,143
Called for a taxi?

239
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:11,475
Yes, but isn't this a private taxi?
I called a taxi company.

240
00:20:11,518 --> 00:20:16,975
Ah yes, but the company's
cars are all busy.

241
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:18,600
So I volunteered...

242
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,350
Does he understand what's going on?

243
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,433
Of course. I explained everything.

244
00:20:23,518 --> 00:20:24,893
You were told everything?

245
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,183
Yes, to Gwang-ju and back
before curfew for 100,000 won.

246
00:20:29,518 --> 00:20:30,893
And you speak English?

247
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:33,100
Of course, of course!

248
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:36,725
Sure, I spent 5 years in Saudi Arabia,
so I speak English.

249
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,600
Don't worry, don't worry! I'm Mr. Kim!

250
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:44,018
Together, let's go Gwang-ju.

251
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:46,518
Okay, nice to meet you!

252
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:48,558
Please get in.

253
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:49,683
OK, okay.

254
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:56,393
Thank you.

255
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:57,643
Be careful.

256
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:15,768
Take another taxi. This one's reserved.

257
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,018
Reserved? For where?

258
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,058
Why?

259
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:21,018
This car's going to Gwang-ju.

260
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:33,100
You Korea first time?

261
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:37,183
No. It's my second time.

262
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:38,308
Oh really?

263
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,850
You are where from?

264
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,850
Germany.

265
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,643
Germany, oh really?

266
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,350
My friend...

267
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,350
What's the word for that?

268
00:21:55,475 --> 00:21:56,558
He went to mine coal.

269
00:21:58,018 --> 00:22:00,600
I know, there are many
Korean workers in Germany.

270
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,850
Nurses, miners.

271
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,393
I was in Saudi, you know?

272
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:08,350
Do you know Saudi? This taxi, Saudi money.

273
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,350
I drive Saudi truck.

274
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:13,850
Driving in that desert, shit!

275
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:16,018
People here don't have a damned clue!

276
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,600
Listen, how far is it to Gwang-ju?

277
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:21,603
I don't have much time, I
need to go there quick.

278
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:23,768
Why is he talking so fast?

279
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:28,268
You, fast. Huh? Slow...

280
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:31,225
So that I can English.

281
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,058
Slow, okay?

282
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,558
Okay. Gwang-ju, we go fast. Okay? Fast!

283
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:39,308
What's the hurry?

284
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:41,100
Gwang-ju, don't worry! Don't worry!

285
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:42,433
I'm best driver.

286
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:45,268
It's really far. Get some sleep.

287
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:47,600
Sleep... sleep.

288
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,433
You darling, you!

289
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,893
My recent luck's been
shit all for this day.

290
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,183
Hey hey, Gwang-ju! Gwang-ju!

291
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:00,725
Gwang-ju? Are we here?

292
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:17,558
What's this? Can we go?

293
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:21,683
Don't slow down, keep going!

294
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,643
Uh, yes, yes.

295
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:25,808
What's he shooting?

296
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:28,268
What picture, what camera?

297
00:24:28,308 --> 00:24:29,308
Let's go, hurry!

298
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,725
Why so rude? If I ask
you something, answer.

299
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,933
And what's with this road?
Can I pass, or not?

300
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,643
What's this?

301
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,183
I'm not a reporter, you understand?

302
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:07,183
Huh? What?

303
00:25:07,683 --> 00:25:09,058
I said to speak slow!

304
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,975
Are they training?

305
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:20,975
Stop!

306
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,725
Is this a training exercise?

307
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,183
What division?

308
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,725
I did my service in the 7th division.

309
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,768
This is a real operation. Turn back.

310
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:34,393
Didn't you see the sign?

311
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:38,393
My passenger's going to Gwang-ju.

312
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,100
You idiot, are you trying to die?

313
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,268
Who the hell are you?

314
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,518
What is he saying?

315
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:48,893
Is he asking me something?

316
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,183
What did he just say?

317
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,058
He said, let's go back. He made a mistake.

318
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,850
Allegiance!

319
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:14,933
Excuse me, Driver. This
direction, also Gwang-ju?

320
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,308
No, no Gwang-ju. Now, we go Seoul.

321
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:23,725
Seoul?

322
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:27,308
What are you talking about?
I have to go to Gwang-ju.

323
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,268
That's what you think, and
it's not that I refuse.

324
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:32,643
Soldier say, Gwang-ju no!

325
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:37,768
Okay, you won't get paid
if you don't take me to Gwang-ju.

326
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:39,643
You understand?

327
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:42,143
What's he saying?

328
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,808
No Gwang-ju, no money.

329
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,850
No money?

330
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,143
Are you joking? You know
how much gas we used?

331
00:26:52,183 --> 00:26:53,683
Soldier say no Gwang-ju!

332
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:55,308
We can't go there!

333
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,558
No Gwang-ju!

334
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,558
You what camera picture?

335
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:02,058
Why you Gwang-ju?

336
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Oh my god.

337
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:05,393
You know what, just take me to Gwang-ju.

338
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,326
That's all you should worry
about what I'm doing there.

339
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,725
It's none of your business, okay?

340
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,308
Business?

341
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:15,933
You businessman?

342
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:17,225
So you go to Gwang-ju?

343
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,558
Yes, Gwang-ju.

344
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,018
No Gwang-ju, no money.

345
00:27:25,308 --> 00:27:28,225
Shit, am I just going to waste gas money?

346
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,393
Sir!

347
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,143
Let me ask you something.

348
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:51,183
Is there any back road
to Gwang-ju around here?

349
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:52,683
Nope.

350
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,850
Then, is there anyone who'd know...

351
00:27:57,893 --> 00:27:59,893
What do you want there?

352
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,975
Didn't you see the soldiers?

353
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,475
You'd be better off heading back home.

354
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,393
Sir, if I can't get to Gwang-ju...

355
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:15,393
Sir, I really need to go there!

356
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:22,058
Our village foreman told us
to stay clear of Gwang-ju.

357
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:33,268
Over that there hill,
there is one back road...

358
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,643
Where is it?

359
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:36,643
Over there...

360
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:38,893
Over that side...

361
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:50,393
This road's gonna ruin my shocks.

362
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:54,683
You're lucky to have me, you know?

363
00:28:54,725 --> 00:28:57,725
Any other driver would
be back in Seoul by now.

364
00:28:59,725 --> 00:29:01,893
Here, no soldier!

365
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:06,558
Yeah, great. No soldier.

366
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:18,143
What's going on, for them
to block even this road?

367
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,475
Stop! Who the hell...

368
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:23,893
Turn back.

369
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,475
I'm just trying to earn some money...

370
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,975
You said you're a businessman?

371
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,643
Dollars, contract.

372
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:32,725
Contract...

373
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,350
Something like this.

374
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,058
Very very important paper!

375
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:41,350
You forgot this, okay? In Gwang-ju.

376
00:29:42,308 --> 00:29:43,308
What?

377
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:46,850
Good day, sir! Allegiance!

378
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:47,683
Yes.

379
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,725
I'm coming from Gimpo Airport.

380
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,433
That guy is a really important businessman.

381
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:56,600
He had to miss his plane to U.S.,
and return for important papers.

382
00:29:56,643 --> 00:29:58,268
No. Turn back!

383
00:29:58,308 --> 00:29:59,433
Please listen.

384
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:03,183
Without those papers, we
can't export to the U.S.

385
00:30:03,225 --> 00:30:06,475
I came speeding here from the
airport all out of patriotism!

386
00:30:06,518 --> 00:30:09,558
We need to export so we can like,
get dollars! Yeah?

387
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,451
- What's wrong?
- To become a developed country...

388
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:12,518
Hold on a sec.

389
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Listen!

390
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:18,433
If I don't get to Gwang-ju there
will be problems, big problems!

391
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:20,518
My boss is a very important man.

392
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,808
He'll be very unhappy if I don't
get back with those documents.

393
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,600
Very very unhappy! Tell him.

394
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,100
What did he say?

395
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,018
You said a hugely important...?

396
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:33,433
Tell him, not me.

397
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,475
Very very important paper, okay?

398
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:36,850
Very important paper.

399
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:40,558
Important man, important paper.
Big, big trouble!

400
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,643
Hey, clear a path.

401
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:56,433
But come right back.

402
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:58,518
It's dangerous there
because of the rioters.

403
00:30:59,143 --> 00:31:00,683
- Rioters?
- Yes.

404
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,600
Yes, we'll be back in a flash.

405
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:05,850
- Allegiance!
- Yes.

406
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,518
Nice job back there!

407
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:29,143
My fare.

408
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,975
100,000 won now.

409
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,475
I've told you, I'll pay you
once we get back to Seoul.

410
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:37,850
Gwang-ju dangerous.

411
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:38,933
So pay in advance.

412
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:40,058
First money.

413
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:43,100
No, it's "Ladies first," so...

414
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:44,518
Money first.

415
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:46,518
Korea business style.

416
00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:48,893
Now no money, I go Seoul.

417
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:50,433
Your choice.

418
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,808
Go ahead and glare at me, you jerk.

419
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:56,600
Your choice!

420
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:10,933
You'll get the rest in Seoul.

421
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:12,643
Your choice!

422
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,643
What a fox. Are you copying me?

423
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,433
Still, 50,000 is nice.

424
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,100
I choice! Let's go Gwang-ju, okay?

425
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:26,268
Alrighty!

426
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,600
What a miser.

427
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:32,518
Glare at me like that and
I'll rip your eyes out.

428
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:36,433
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

429
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,975
Let's go Gwang-ju,

430
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,393
that's all I said.

431
00:32:44,725 --> 00:32:46,768
To the citizens of democratic Gwang-ju...

432
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:01,225
Defend Democracy to the Death!

433
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,475
What's going on here?

434
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:05,725
Rescind martial law!

435
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:09,768
Stop the car, Driver. What does that mean?

436
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:11,018
Huh? What?

437
00:33:11,393 --> 00:33:14,058
To the 1980s, Decade of Hope!

438
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,725
It says...

439
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,683
Hope, hope. Eight.

440
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:21,643
Ah, 80, 80. Hope.

441
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:22,808
Hope?

442
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,058
In the 1980s...

443
00:33:25,475 --> 00:33:27,768
Oh, it's just some crap. Forget about it.

444
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,018
What's that?

445
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,183
Wait, stop! Pull over.

446
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,683
Hey look, it's a Seoul taxi.

447
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,393
Whoa, it's a foreigner.

448
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,893
Hi. Where are you going?

449
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,201
- What's he saying?
- Well...

450
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:49,475
Isn't that a camera?

451
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:54,433
Those university students
speak worse English than me.

452
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:58,143
Hey, Jae-sik! You speak
some English, right?

453
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,558
Get over here, Jae-sik.

454
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,768
Why me?

455
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:06,558
Hi.

456
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:07,893
Hi.

457
00:34:07,933 --> 00:34:09,018
Where are you going?

458
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,183
Where are you from?

459
00:34:14,558 --> 00:34:17,018
Germany. German broadcast, ARD.

460
00:34:17,143 --> 00:34:22,643
German. Um.. Are you a reporter?

461
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,143
Yes. I am a reporter.

462
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:30,393
He's a reporter from
Germany, come to shoot us.

463
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:37,393
We'll be on the news. Great!

464
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,893
Businessman, my ass.

465
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:41,576
If you're a reporter,
you should've told me!

466
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,475
He rode here in a taxi from Seoul!

467
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,683
Let's give a hand to the
taxi driver who came so far!

468
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,558
Ah well, from Seoul to here...

469
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,850
Where are you headed now?

470
00:34:52,893 --> 00:34:53,893
...is pretty far.

471
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,808
We go to the hospital for the sick.

472
00:34:59,475 --> 00:35:00,475
Can I come with you?

473
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:02,143
Yes.

474
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,350
I'd like to interview him.

475
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:07,600
He wants to interview you.

476
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:09,893
Wow, you're a star now!

477
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:13,143
Ah, I should've at least washed my face.

478
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,683
You come up too, Mister.

479
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:24,808
What do you mean?

480
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,518
He needs to drive his taxi.

481
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:28,433
Don't worry, don't worry.

482
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:31,183
I'll be right behind you.

483
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:33,183
Me too go!

484
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:35,143
Then follow us!

485
00:35:36,683 --> 00:35:37,975
Let's go!

486
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,850
♪ We fight for justice, hoorah hoorah! ♪

487
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:52,643

488
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:55,725

490
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,768
I should've known 100,000 won
was too good to be true.

491
00:36:02,518 --> 00:36:05,475
♪ Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite! ♪

492
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:09,350

00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:12,433
♪ Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite! ♪

494
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:27,058
Can't risk my car getting damaged
in the protest again.

495
00:36:31,183 --> 00:36:32,600
Oh my, taxi!

496
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:35,433
Give me a lift, mister!

497
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:38,683
Take a Gwang-ju taxi, granny.
This is a Seoul taxi.

498
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:43,518
Oh, jeez.

499
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:54,268
Granny, can you even pay the fare?

500
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,350
Who's in the hospital?

501
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,558
They said someone who looks
like my youngest son

502
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,393
was brought there after
a soldier smashed his head.

503
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,893
Is he a university student?
Does he protest?

504
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:14,018
He didn't even go to high school.

505
00:37:14,893 --> 00:37:18,393
Didn't come home last night.

506
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:23,350
Then he must have been out
drinking with his friends!

507
00:37:23,768 --> 00:37:26,018
He can't drink.

508
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:32,018
And those soldiers, they've gone berserk,

509
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:38,018
beating and stabbing anyone who passes by.

510
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,558
Granny, I was an army sergeant.
No soldier would ever do that.

511
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,643
Those are all just rumors, right?

512
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:47,808
Of course...

513
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:54,518
Then where the heck did he go?

514
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,893
No, I won't take you!

515
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:17,350
Go see if they need help.

516
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:20,393
Please drive. I have to rush.

517
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,893
What's your hurry?

518
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:25,143
You don't write a single
line in the newspaper!

519
00:38:25,475 --> 00:38:28,475
You reporters have more
time than anyone now!

520
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:32,225
If reporters don't report,
why should we drive?

521
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:36,268
Gwang-ju taxi drivers must be rich,
turning down fares like that.

522
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:40,100
Ma'am.

523
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:42,475
Please give me a ride.

524
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:43,558
No way.

525
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:44,768
Damn it!

526
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:46,975
Taxi, taxi!

527
00:38:47,018 --> 00:38:49,768
No, this is a Seoul taxi.
Take a Gwang-ju taxi.

528
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:57,225
Go to the other side!

529
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:58,268
Oh my.

530
00:38:59,058 --> 00:39:00,433
What a mess.

531
00:39:00,475 --> 00:39:01,600
A high school student?

532
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:02,893
Careful!

533
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,393
Go call a doctor!

534
00:39:06,558 --> 00:39:07,725
Doctor!

535
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:09,058
Doctor!

536
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:14,893
Please find my youngest son.
I beg you, please...

537
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:18,725
Where are you, Yong-pyo?

538
00:39:34,225 --> 00:39:37,643
Oh, Yong-pyo! My son...

539
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:42,768
Are you okay?

540
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:43,808
Mom?

541
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:46,350
Mom!

542
00:39:46,393 --> 00:39:47,518
Yong-pyo!

543
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,058
What are you doin' here?

544
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:51,768
Oh, you wicked boy!

545
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,475
I thought something awful happened to you.

546
00:39:56,558 --> 00:39:59,350
Are you okay?

547
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:02,808
This ain't nothin' at all.
Just three stitches.

548
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,893
Are you hurt anywhere else?

549
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,100
I'm totally fine.

550
00:40:10,183 --> 00:40:13,433
- Sir, thank you so much!
- Oh...

551
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:14,933
Thank you, really.

552
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:16,225
Mom, wear this.

553
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Don't know what I'd have done
without this taxi driver.

554
00:40:20,643 --> 00:40:21,725
Thank you so much.

555
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:24,643
You got some money?

556
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:26,518
I ain't got money.

557
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:29,225
Never mind, you don't need to pay me.

558
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:31,558
See, I told you he'd be fine!

559
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:34,558
Wait! Are you that Seoul taxi...

560
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:37,100
You know me?

561
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,143
It's you!

562
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,100
Yong-pyo, you know him?

563
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:43,893
- A while back, this guy...
- Hey, mister!

564
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:48,268
What's he doing here?

565
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:50,668
Do you have any idea how much
time I wasted looking for you?

566
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:52,975
We've been driving all
over trying to find you!

567
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,268
Where is my film bag?

568
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:57,975
Who is he to yell at my driver!

569
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:01,725
He ran off with this reporter's
expensive equipment.

570
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,350
What are you talking about?

571
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,058
How dare you!

572
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,933
I took what? I didn't take anything!

573
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:11,308
What's going on?

574
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,350
His...

575
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:14,018
Look here!

576
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,183
What's this doing here?

577
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:23,643
I don't know.

578
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,143
I really didn't know.

579
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:27,933
You said to follow, and then you sped off.

580
00:41:28,558 --> 00:41:32,518
I don't know the roads here.
You know how hard I searched?

581
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,725
Hey mister, that ain't so.

582
00:41:35,558 --> 00:41:37,558
People saw you take a U-turn.

583
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,393
Hey, Yong-pyo! Watch it.

584
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:43,143
Would he really take off
without collecting his fare?

585
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:46,558
Here, the other half of the fare.

586
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,100
So you just go back to Seoul.
I'm better off on my own.

587
00:41:49,393 --> 00:41:52,808
What? He charged 50,000
won just to come here?

588
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:57,725
Actually, they agreed on 100,000,
and he already received half.

589
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,058
100,000 won?

590
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,393
What? So he got paid and tried to run off?

591
00:42:04,518 --> 00:42:05,643
Take this and go!

592
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:07,683
Just take it.

593
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:11,225
Why are you giving this guy money?

594
00:42:11,975 --> 00:42:13,893
He's giving us all a bad name.

595
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:18,643
Taxi drivers like this need
to be taught a lesson!

596
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,933
Whose side are you guys on, anyway?

597
00:42:22,058 --> 00:42:23,808
How dare you start shouting!

598
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:26,933
Bro, am I wrong?

599
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:29,433
Why don't you say something?

600
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:30,725
What would I say?

601
00:42:32,808 --> 00:42:35,225
If he received his fare...

602
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:38,433
would he really just ditch his passenger?

603
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:42,143
Man, you're so wishy-washy.

604
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,100
I'm not wishy-washy.

605
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:47,433
I'm firm when I need to be.
Don't you know me?

606
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:51,018
Hey, Seoul Driver! You'll
pay for doing that.

607
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,308
As a driver it's wrong, and
as a human being it's wrong!

608
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,475
How dare you talk to me that way!

609
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:04,143
I guess everything they
said about you was true!

610
00:43:04,558 --> 00:43:06,725
Let me take a look at your license number.

611
00:43:06,768 --> 00:43:08,933
What the hell are you doing?

612
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,100
Here!

613
00:43:14,183 --> 00:43:16,850
I'm not receiving anything, alright?

614
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Let's go.

615
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:43,393
College boy! Are you gonna
ride around in my car all day?

616
00:43:45,518 --> 00:43:47,600
He asked me to translate...

617
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:50,768
Do your parents know what you're doing?

618
00:43:50,933 --> 00:43:52,933
Why are you chewing me out?

619
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:55,225
Didn't you see back there?

620
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,933
Your mother must be worried sick.

621
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:03,683
Paying that expensive tuition, did
you go to university to protest?

622
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,933
You went to study, right?
Then you should study, dammit!

623
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:10,268
I didn't go to university to study.

624
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:16,810
I went to compete in the
university song contest.

625
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:25,225
Then why not spend this time
practicing your singing?

626
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:28,975
Mister, you don't know
what you're talking about.

627
00:44:29,018 --> 00:44:33,143
You students think other
countries are as nice as ours?

628
00:44:33,183 --> 00:44:35,058
Go to Saudi Arabia! In that hot, burning...

629
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,225
What's so great about a country
where soldiers assault you?

630
00:44:38,268 --> 00:44:40,433
Then why do you keep protesting?

631
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:44,143
They keep telling you to
stop, but you won't listen!

632
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,268
How is it that this foreigner
understands better than you?

633
00:44:48,308 --> 00:44:49,350
Forget it.

634
00:44:49,393 --> 00:44:50,975
Seven o'clock go Seoul, okay?

635
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:54,933
Okay.

636
00:44:55,433 --> 00:44:57,100
Promise, seven o'clock!

637
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:00,268
Is he going in the right direction?

638
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:04,850
Yeah, don't worry. This
is the right direction.

639
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:07,643
We turn right here, and then we go more.

640
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
There!

641
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:11,683
Oh my god!

642
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:13,643
Mister, you missed the right turn!

643
00:45:14,018 --> 00:45:15,350
Gas, gas!

644
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:17,225
I'm going to fill the gas tank!

645
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,225
Goddamn!

646
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,683
Gas...

647
00:45:30,143 --> 00:45:31,475
Stop, stop.

648
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:35,033
3,000 won's worth, but like a full tank.

649
00:45:36,225 --> 00:45:38,143
Who do you think I am?

650
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:41,558
I'm not that kind of person!

651
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,393
What did I just say?

652
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:49,534
You're not that kind of person.

653
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:51,475
No, I said 3,000 won.

654
00:45:52,058 --> 00:45:53,058
- Right?
- Yes.

655
00:45:54,183 --> 00:45:57,558
Stop pumping! What, are you crazy?

656
00:45:58,393 --> 00:46:00,768
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

657
00:46:00,808 --> 00:46:03,475
I asked for 3,000 won's worth.
3,000 won only!

658
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:04,518
What?

659
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:06,558
You think I'm gonna pay more?

660
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,975
I may be an out-of-towner,
but this is outrageous!

661
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,225
I'm only gonna pay 3,000 won.

662
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,433
Look at this guy.

663
00:46:14,183 --> 00:46:16,643
What are you so angry about,

664
00:46:16,683 --> 00:46:20,308
me giving you a bit more gas
when it's all free anyway.

665
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:25,018
If I filled it full, you'd
have me by the throat.

666
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:27,308
Free?

667
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:30,475
Did you think everyone in
Gwang-ju was just like you?

668
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:32,683
Ouch!

669
00:46:39,393 --> 00:46:43,018
Why didn't you say it's free?
I'd have filled the tank full.

670
00:46:43,058 --> 00:46:47,100
Then fill it before you head back to Seoul.

671
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,808
Of course! The gas fare to Seoul is costly.

672
00:46:50,893 --> 00:46:52,183
But why is it free?

673
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:53,933
You saw that taxi at the hospital?

674
00:46:54,225 --> 00:46:56,808
Taxi drivers have one helluva
of a job these days.

675
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:59,600
Some were arrested for
transporting wounded people.

676
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:04,308
What's wrong about that?
You can't choose who you take.

677
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,768
That's my point.

678
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:09,350
We didn't do anything wrong
to be suffering like this.

679
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,393
Gwang-ju citizens, to
the Provincial Office!

680
00:47:21,683 --> 00:47:23,768
Drive out the martial law soldiers!

681
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,600
That way, mister. Over there.

682
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:32,893
Citizens of Gwang-ju! We're
all in this together!

683
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,475
Drive out the soldiers!

684
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:39,933
Drive them out and protect our city!

685
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:49,768
Citizens of Gwang-ju!
Let's all take action!

686
00:47:50,933 --> 00:47:53,768
Coming through! News reporter here!

687
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:59,933
All the way from Seoul to
report, so please make way.

688
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:01,558
Thank you, thanks!

689
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,058
That's a reporter!

690
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:05,518
A foreigner?

691
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,558
Thank you!

692
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:09,475
Flew all the way here?

693
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,600
Make way, people!

694
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:26,183
Best to set out on a full stomach.
Have some.

695
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:28,558
What's this? Thank you.

696
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:31,975
- Hungry? Try one.
- Thank you.

697
00:48:32,018 --> 00:48:34,183
- Is it okay to take this?
- We already ate!

698
00:48:34,225 --> 00:48:35,808
Thanks so much!

699
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,518
Thanks to you, too!

700
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:07,850
Mister, we'll be back in no time.
Why bother?

701
00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:11,393
If my car gets scratched,
are you gonna pay for it?

702
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:14,058
Hey!

703
00:49:26,018 --> 00:49:29,143
Hello? Where are you from?

704
00:49:29,643 --> 00:49:32,143
ARD Germany. My name is Peter.

705
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,308
I'm Choi, a local reporter.
How did you get here?

706
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,268
I heard all the roads to
Gwang-ju are blocked.

707
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:40,475
I came by taxi.

708
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,143
Live and die together, hoorah hoorah!

709
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,268
We'd rather die standing
than live on our knees!

710
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:58,018
We fight for justice!

711
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,475
Afternoon of May 20,
1980 Geumnam Street, Gwang-ju

712
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:06,433
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

713
00:50:06,768 --> 00:50:10,183
Citizens of Gwang-ju, citizens of Gwang-ju,

714
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:12,558
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

715
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,808
Can you hold this?

716
00:50:14,975 --> 00:50:16,268
Yeah, okay, sure.

717
00:50:18,308 --> 00:50:19,600
What a jerk.

718
00:50:39,683 --> 00:50:43,683
Wow, Jeolla Province really
does have the best food.

719
00:50:44,183 --> 00:50:46,768
Looks simple, but tastes great.

720
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:48,143
The seasoning is perfect!

721
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:49,225
Be very careful.

722
00:50:50,058 --> 00:50:54,100
The Korean press is not allowed here,
and foreign press is not welcome.

723
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:58,225
If they find you are here, the
government will hunt you down.

724
00:50:59,058 --> 00:51:01,600
And the people helping you.

725
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,518
What, you want one?

726
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,518
Have a bite. Nothing's happening there.

727
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:13,643
No, thank you.

728
00:51:14,183 --> 00:51:16,268
Why so serious all of a sudden?

729
00:51:16,433 --> 00:51:17,518
It's nothing.

730
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,308
I have to join them.

731
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,058
Don't get involved, stay here.

732
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:30,268
How can I just watch?

733
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:32,393
What difference will it make?

734
00:52:33,018 --> 00:52:34,475
Okay. Let's get down there.

735
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:36,350
Where? There?

736
00:52:36,393 --> 00:52:39,225
No, no, no, here stay. There danger.

737
00:52:39,268 --> 00:52:40,268
Here safe.

738
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:41,725
You stay, we go down.

739
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:43,893
That guy's just shooting from up here, too.

740
00:52:44,308 --> 00:52:45,433
Where are you going?

741
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,893
What's going on?

742
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:06,058
Drive out Chun Doo-hwan!

743
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,475
Danger, danger.

744
00:53:16,725 --> 00:53:18,768
If you're gonna shoot, do it from there.

745
00:53:18,808 --> 00:53:20,518
It's too dangerous here.

746
00:53:21,018 --> 00:53:22,433
Let's go, will you?

747
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:27,808
Are you okay?

748
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:28,850
Sorry, sorry!

749
00:53:29,058 --> 00:53:30,244
What the hell is wrong with you?

750
00:53:30,268 --> 00:53:33,225
That's why I said, it's too dangerous here!

751
00:53:34,308 --> 00:53:36,018
- Let's go.
- Don't touch!

752
00:54:20,058 --> 00:54:22,393
Mister, the soldiers have gone crazy.

753
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:24,225
Hurry up and run!

754
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:28,768
Damned commie needs to be taught a lesson!

755
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,808
Get rid of him!

756
00:54:33,768 --> 00:54:35,768
Hey, who's that?

757
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,850
Get him.

758
00:54:38,018 --> 00:54:41,725
Do you have a death wish? We need to go!

759
00:54:49,268 --> 00:54:51,100
Mister, this way! This way!

760
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:52,225
Over here!

761
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:53,268
Hurry!

762
00:55:26,225 --> 00:55:27,643
Huh? Isn't she...?

763
00:55:36,143 --> 00:55:37,143
Mister!

764
00:55:42,975 --> 00:55:45,100
Mister, hurry up!

765
00:56:12,683 --> 00:56:14,975
That's why I kept saying danger!

766
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:20,268
Is that thing expensive?

767
00:56:21,018 --> 00:56:24,643
I've never seen one before.
Should I ask him?

768
00:56:24,683 --> 00:56:26,683
No, don't ask.

769
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,100
What? It wasn't my fault.

770
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:38,600
But why were those
soldiers acting that way?

771
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:43,225
Beating and chasing people
who weren't doing anything.

772
00:56:44,518 --> 00:56:47,808
I don't know either. We
just don't know why.

773
00:56:49,268 --> 00:56:50,975
Oh god, look at the time.

774
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:52,808
Hey! Let's go Seoul.

775
00:56:54,268 --> 00:56:56,183
Yeah, okay. Let's go back to Seoul.

776
00:56:56,225 --> 00:56:57,225
Okay, okay.

777
00:56:57,975 --> 00:57:00,308
Then, what about you? We're going to Seoul.

778
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:04,643
Yes, of course. Then let me off up there.

779
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:05,725
- Okay.
- Thanks.

780
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,308
Please promise me.

781
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,100
You have to show our news.

782
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:24,350
Once this footage airs,
the entire world will be watching.

783
00:57:25,225 --> 00:57:26,350
You are not alone.

784
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,725
Thank you so much.

785
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:39,643
Sir, have a safe trip back.

786
00:57:40,268 --> 00:57:41,518
Wait, kid!

787
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,058
What's your name?

788
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:47,143
Jae-sik. Gu Jae-sik.

789
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:50,100
Gu Jae-sik... Practice hard, okay?

790
00:57:50,143 --> 00:57:51,850
I'll watch your song contest on TV.

791
00:57:53,475 --> 00:57:54,475
Okay.

792
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,393
Have a safe trip.

793
00:58:16,768 --> 00:58:19,143
Come on, not again.

794
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:29,268
Did it break down?

795
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:31,768
What happened?

796
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:00,975
Isn't that...?

797
00:59:01,183 --> 00:59:03,350
I told you it was him! The Seoul driver.

798
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:04,725
You were right.

799
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:05,808
Car's broken?

800
00:59:06,268 --> 00:59:08,018
That's bad.

801
00:59:08,518 --> 00:59:10,475
Man, the repair shop's closed.

802
00:59:10,518 --> 00:59:12,100
- Sure is.
- Yeah.

803
00:59:30,393 --> 00:59:32,100
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

804
00:59:45,058 --> 00:59:46,268
Wow!

805
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:49,433
Is this your daughter?

806
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,518
Whoa, she's so cute!

807
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:55,893
You've got hidden talents!
And your wife is pretty too.

808
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,183
What a relief she took after
her mother instead of...

809
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:06,018
His daughter, huh? Pretty, isn't it?

810
01:00:06,058 --> 01:00:08,183
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

811
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:09,308
No touch!

812
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:15,558
You ready?

813
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,768
- Yeah, just a sec.
- Okay.

814
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:18,725
Ready. Try starting it!

815
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:20,100
Give it a go.

816
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:31,975
This car already ran over 600,000 km!

817
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:35,308
How'd you drive all the way here?

818
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,225
- The transmission is too old.
- Need to change the starter?

819
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,393
That's a bummer.

820
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:44,725
I heard the repair shop's all out of parts.

821
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:51,393
What about parts from another car?
He can have mine.

822
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:57,308
I changed my starter recently,
so better switch with mine.

823
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,893
Then, leave it here for now.

824
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:04,143
I'll find a way to make
it run a short distance.

825
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:05,475
How long will it take?

826
01:01:05,933 --> 01:01:07,768
I need to be in Seoul before the curfew.

827
01:01:09,018 --> 01:01:11,433
- It'll take at least 2 hours.
- Yeah.

828
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:13,600
Better leave for Seoul tomorrow.

829
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:15,768
Curfew here is 9 o'clock.

830
01:01:15,808 --> 01:01:18,018
You don't want to be out past curfew.

831
01:01:19,018 --> 01:01:20,768
- Is there a phone somewhere?
- What for?

832
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:23,725
Those bastards have cut
all the phone lines.

833
01:01:23,768 --> 01:01:24,768
What?

834
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,643
Isn't there any way? I need to call home.

835
01:01:31,683 --> 01:01:34,143
What're you so worried about?

836
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:36,768
If a man's out working, he
can stay out a night or two.

837
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:41,475
My daughter's home alone.
And she's only 11.

838
01:01:41,518 --> 01:01:43,433
Then where's her mom?

839
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:44,433
What?

840
01:01:44,475 --> 01:01:45,933
Oh, that poor thing.

841
01:01:46,643 --> 01:01:48,558
Too young to be alone...

842
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:53,225
Oh my.

843
01:01:56,933 --> 01:02:00,683
Mr. Kim, if it's about money,
let me pay for the repairs.

844
01:02:04,558 --> 01:02:06,600
You bastard, did I ask you for money?

845
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:10,225
You knew everything, right?

846
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,850
Danger, you knew it!

847
01:02:11,893 --> 01:02:12,975
Why are you yelling at me?

848
01:02:13,018 --> 01:02:14,534
It's not my fault your car broke down.

849
01:02:14,558 --> 01:02:16,638
And you knew exactly that
it would be dangerous here!

850
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,268
What's this prick saying?

851
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:22,183
Mister, calm down! He
says you knew the danger.

852
01:02:22,225 --> 01:02:24,225
Bullshit! Like hell I did!

853
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:27,518
And why do you keep taking
this foreigner's side, huh?

854
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:28,808
What?

855
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:30,433
Just take the money.

856
01:02:30,475 --> 01:02:32,393
Take the money. Take the money, here.

857
01:02:32,558 --> 01:02:34,183
Get that away from me!

858
01:02:34,225 --> 01:02:35,225
Get it away!

859
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,725
Oh my.

860
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:43,850
Just stop it!

861
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:46,643
Just calm down, stop it!

862
01:02:49,393 --> 01:02:51,393
My, oh my...

863
01:03:12,475 --> 01:03:14,018
His young daughter at home alone.

864
01:03:14,518 --> 01:03:17,683
But he can't go back to Seoul.
He cannot call.

865
01:03:20,725 --> 01:03:24,143
Jürgen Hinzpeter, Asia Correspondent
for Germany's public broadcaster.

866
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:27,018
He came in from Japan.

867
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,558
What are those assholes
in the security service doing?

868
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,393
He entered without registering as
a reporter, so they missed him.

869
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:42,518
He declared himself a missionary.

870
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:46,308
He seems to have planned the whole thing.

871
01:03:47,808 --> 01:03:51,225
He's using a Seoul taxi,
so we'll find him soon.

872
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,433
So that's where you live...
the corner house?

873
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:55,725
Yes, next to it.

874
01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:57,893
We're almost here.

875
01:04:04,768 --> 01:04:05,975
Come on, hurry.

876
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:11,808
Honey? I'm home!

877
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:14,725
Dad!

878
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,475
Goodness, why are you back so late?

879
01:04:17,518 --> 01:04:18,933
There was a lot going on.

880
01:04:19,643 --> 01:04:22,518
Did you stay up waiting for Daddy?

881
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,183
Who are they?

882
01:04:25,225 --> 01:04:27,683
It's a long story. Can you make us dinner?

883
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:31,933
- Yes, but not much to eat.
- Fine with just kimchi.

884
01:04:31,975 --> 01:04:34,475
Come on, let's go in. Please...

885
01:04:37,018 --> 01:04:38,558
It's okay if we have kimchi...

886
01:04:39,393 --> 01:04:40,643
Get in!

887
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:49,143
Oh, my!

888
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:53,350
Is this all we've got for
such important guests?

889
01:04:57,975 --> 01:05:02,058
Don't worry. Your neighbor will
look after your daughter.

890
01:05:02,643 --> 01:05:05,893
You can call her on the
way tomorrow morning.

891
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:07,393
Yes.

892
01:05:07,433 --> 01:05:09,308
Dad, I'm hungry.

893
01:05:09,683 --> 01:05:12,183
Oh, go ahead and eat. You're hungry?

894
01:05:12,225 --> 01:05:16,518
Try this first. My wife made it.

895
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:19,975
It's crisp, slightly bitter,
but with a real kick...

896
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:23,018
Not sure if it's your
style, but please try.

897
01:05:23,058 --> 01:05:24,350
Give it a try.

898
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:29,933
That's hot!

899
01:05:29,975 --> 01:05:31,725
This is spicy, hot.

900
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:34,058
Oh, not a problem. I can handle spicy.

901
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,683
Wow, he eats well.

902
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,268
Oh my god. This is a shock.

903
01:05:43,518 --> 01:05:44,518
Wasser!

904
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:46,600
- What?
- Water!

905
01:05:50,725 --> 01:05:52,475
Too spicy for him!

906
01:05:53,393 --> 01:05:54,100
Hot!

907
01:05:54,143 --> 01:05:57,268
No wonder. He ate it too easy.

908
01:06:00,183 --> 01:06:01,850
What are you laughing for?

909
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:06,268
You come to a foreign country,
break a camera, eat kimchi.

910
01:06:06,308 --> 01:06:08,143
You've been through a lot, too.

911
01:06:12,183 --> 01:06:13,308
Why'd you come here?

912
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,725
Why you come here?

913
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:16,893
Reporter.

914
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:18,808
Was that English?

915
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:22,393
Seoul drivers speak English?

916
01:06:22,433 --> 01:06:23,683
I'm a reporter.

917
01:06:24,183 --> 01:06:26,518
Reporters go wherever there is news.

918
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:29,100
Then try translating what he just said.

919
01:06:31,808 --> 01:06:37,768
I'm a reporter here for the
news something like that...

920
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:40,475
Is that right?

921
01:06:41,018 --> 01:06:42,018
Yes.

922
01:06:43,808 --> 01:06:46,850
You're amazing. I never would've guessed!

923
01:06:47,643 --> 01:06:48,643
Ah...

924
01:06:49,475 --> 01:06:51,225
Why you become a reporter?

925
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:55,975
What's that, a poker card?
I used to play, too...

926
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,018
Not that, money. He means money.

927
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:01,393
He means he did it because of the money?

928
01:07:01,808 --> 01:07:02,683
Yes.

929
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:05,975
Where do you spend your money?

930
01:07:13,225 --> 01:07:14,475
A hole in your sock.

931
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:19,183
He acts like such a big shot,
but I guess he's not.

932
01:07:19,393 --> 01:07:22,100
How can you be worse off
than a widower like me?

933
01:07:31,058 --> 01:07:33,143
Martial Law Soldiers
Massacre Civilians in Gwang-ju

934
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:35,058
Now that's a real newspaper!

935
01:07:36,058 --> 01:07:39,975
There's no turning back after this.
So if anyone...

936
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,768
Are you the only reporter here?

937
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,268
We've all made up our minds.

938
01:07:45,308 --> 01:07:47,893
Open the door!

939
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:09,600
Are you trying to close us down?

940
01:08:09,643 --> 01:08:13,850
But Chief! We're reporters, aren't we?

941
01:08:13,893 --> 01:08:17,933
Shouldn't we at least
try to tell the people

942
01:08:18,558 --> 01:08:22,600
what's happening here and why?

943
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:24,643
What will happen then?

944
01:08:25,683 --> 01:08:29,725
They will shut us down,
and drag us all off!

945
01:08:29,768 --> 01:08:32,018
Come on, get them out!

946
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:35,683
Let go! Chief! Chief!

947
01:08:40,558 --> 01:08:43,433
Will this stop bullets?

948
01:08:44,143 --> 01:08:47,975
Of course not. It's to cover the lights.

949
01:08:48,018 --> 01:08:49,100
Right.

950
01:08:50,143 --> 01:08:51,558
It's time for evening news.

951
01:08:52,143 --> 01:08:56,058
Why bother watching useless crap?

952
01:08:56,393 --> 01:08:59,558
Who knows, maybe they'll
say something today.

953
01:09:00,768 --> 01:09:02,433
I doubt it...

954
01:09:05,393 --> 01:09:06,826
- The disturbance in Gwang-ju...
- It's on.

955
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,518
Is not yet contained...

956
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:10,600
- Have some fruit.
- Hey, quiet!

957
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:16,350
...with student radicals and
gangsters gathering in Gwang-ju

958
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:20,725
and spreading groundless rumors.

959
01:09:20,768 --> 01:09:24,933
To date, 1 civilian has been killed,
and 5 members of the military...

960
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:27,100
Those fuckers!

961
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:28,143
Honey!

962
01:09:28,183 --> 01:09:31,643
How can they say that?
So many people died today!

963
01:09:31,975 --> 01:09:34,475
Is the news just allowed to lie like that?

964
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:37,975
Why did we have to watch that crap?

965
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:40,183
God that sets me off!

966
01:09:41,768 --> 01:09:42,933
That's not true.

967
01:09:45,808 --> 01:09:50,018
As soon as I get back to Japan,
my footage will hit the news.

968
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,058
The whole world will see.

969
01:09:55,018 --> 01:09:57,768
Mr. Kim will take me back
to the airport, and...

970
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:04,850
Anyhow without him, I would
have never made it to Gwang-ju.

971
01:10:08,808 --> 01:10:13,058
He can broadcast it when he gets
to Japan, with Mr. Kim's help.

972
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:19,058
And Mr. Kim also helped him get pass
the soldiers blocking the roads.

973
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:24,143
You're amazing. Both of you.

974
01:10:25,683 --> 01:10:29,183
Well, a driver has to go
where the customer says.

975
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,183
Don't worry, don't worry.

976
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:32,433
I'll take you right to
the airport tomorrow.

977
01:10:32,683 --> 01:10:33,850
Airport, okay?

978
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:38,225
By the sound of it, I should
plead to both of you...

979
01:10:38,975 --> 01:10:41,058
Please make this work.

980
01:10:41,183 --> 01:10:44,558
I'd beg you on my knees, really!

981
01:10:44,725 --> 01:10:47,600
No, I'm really good at that.

982
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:49,893
On my knees!

983
01:10:50,433 --> 01:10:51,933
Forget that.

984
01:10:51,975 --> 01:10:55,558
Sing us a song instead.
He's entering a song contest.

985
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,518
We'll judge if you deserve
a prize, so sing!

986
01:10:58,558 --> 01:11:00,350
- Oh, no way!
- Please.

987
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,183
I do guitar, not vocals.

988
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,058
What's the difference?

989
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:07,643
Give him a hand!

990
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,518
What should I do?

991
01:11:23,643 --> 01:11:25,475
Wow, looking good!

992
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:36,393
♪ What can I do if you ♪
♪ leave me like this? ♪

993
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,808
♪ What can I do to go on ♪
♪ living without you? ♪

994
01:11:44,475 --> 01:11:46,350
What? Why ring the gong?

995
01:11:46,393 --> 01:11:51,643
Students may protest against
you, to stop you from singing.

996
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:55,643
I told you, I play guitar!
But I'm not that bad!

997
01:11:56,268 --> 01:11:57,768
I shouldn't have asked him to sing.

998
01:11:58,058 --> 01:11:59,183
Is that a new song?

999
01:12:02,558 --> 01:12:04,475
I guess I'm no good.

1000
01:12:05,808 --> 01:12:08,100
You're really not a singer.

1001
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,393
But there's something striking about him.

1002
01:12:14,433 --> 01:12:16,143
See, I told you!

1003
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:19,893
Oh, my. He looks just like your brother.

1004
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:22,558
- That's right!
- Yes, they're similar!

1005
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,433
- You mean Sang-chul?
- Yeah.

1006
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:26,725
Who?

1007
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,393
Right, why didn't I see it before?

1008
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:34,518
I have a younger brother.

1009
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,893
You look just like him.

1010
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:39,183
What do you think? Same-same?

1011
01:12:39,225 --> 01:12:40,909
- What do you mean?
- He looks like my husband.

1012
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:41,933
Same, same.

1013
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,808
I look like Peter, right?

1014
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,850
Oh no!

1015
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:47,518
What's that?

1016
01:12:49,183 --> 01:12:50,308
What's this sound?

1017
01:13:00,558 --> 01:13:04,018
That's by the TV station.

1018
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:05,975
Yeah, I think so.

1019
01:13:06,018 --> 01:13:10,600
Bro! People are gathering
over by the TV station!

1020
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:13,683
The taxi drivers are all
heading there, too.

1021
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,558
- Really?
- I'll see you there.

1022
01:13:17,933 --> 01:13:21,143
Night of May 20, 1980
Near Gwang-ju MBC TV Station

1023
01:13:56,643 --> 01:13:58,518
The foreign reporter! Get the radio!

1024
01:14:27,725 --> 01:14:28,893
Jae-sik!

1025
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:41,143
Mister, look out!

1026
01:14:41,808 --> 01:14:44,018
They're plainclothes soldiers!

1027
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:46,558
What? Plainclothes?

1028
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:00,100
Damned commies!

1029
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,183
Go hide up there. I'll bring it up.

1030
01:15:31,558 --> 01:15:32,558
Hurry!

1031
01:15:50,018 --> 01:15:51,183
Where is he?

1032
01:15:52,518 --> 01:15:55,933
He didn't come this way.

1033
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:07,058
Hello!

1034
01:16:10,058 --> 01:16:12,308
I know you're up there.

1035
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,893
Mister.

1036
01:16:16,768 --> 01:16:19,643
If you give me the camera and film,

1037
01:16:20,558 --> 01:16:21,643
you two,

1038
01:16:21,893 --> 01:16:22,933
no...

1039
01:16:25,558 --> 01:16:28,100
the three of you including this kid...

1040
01:16:29,683 --> 01:16:31,018
can go free.

1041
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:33,975
What is he saying?

1042
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,143
I'll count to ten.

1043
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:51,683
And I'll let you decide

1044
01:16:53,518 --> 01:16:55,183
what the wise choice is.

1045
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,018
He wants this.

1046
01:16:58,183 --> 01:17:00,643
Then we can live, and Jae-sik too.

1047
01:17:01,225 --> 01:17:02,268
Give safe.

1048
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,643
Let's give it to him.

1049
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:07,475
One,

1050
01:17:08,808 --> 01:17:09,975
two,

1051
01:17:16,475 --> 01:17:17,725
three,

1052
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:20,893
four,

1053
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:23,683
five,

1054
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,518
- What are you doing?
- Six,

1055
01:17:29,433 --> 01:17:30,643
seven,

1056
01:17:33,393 --> 01:17:34,600
eight,

1057
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,393
nine...

1058
01:17:39,433 --> 01:17:40,558
Wait a minute!

1059
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:47,100
The foreign reporter might be close by.

1060
01:17:47,268 --> 01:17:50,018
Let me speak in English to him.

1061
01:17:53,433 --> 01:17:55,643
I'll beg him to save me.

1062
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:11,475
Can you hear me?

1063
01:18:15,808 --> 01:18:18,268
I can't hold this soldier much longer.

1064
01:18:23,018 --> 01:18:24,183
So please,

1065
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:28,975
go now and show the world
what's happening in here.

1066
01:18:32,225 --> 01:18:33,683
- Where are you going?
- So please...

1067
01:18:33,725 --> 01:18:35,018
We need to give him this.

1068
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,100
They're coming up!

1069
01:18:40,433 --> 01:18:41,433
Hey!

1070
01:18:46,018 --> 01:18:47,018
Damn!

1071
01:18:48,308 --> 01:18:49,308
Give me the bag!

1072
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:54,433
Get away!

1073
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,725
I'm okay!

1074
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,600
Over there!

1075
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:00,768
Get him!

1076
01:19:20,308 --> 01:19:21,308
There!

1077
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,975
Where's the damn reporter?

1078
01:20:50,183 --> 01:20:52,475
Where are you running, commie?

1079
01:20:52,975 --> 01:20:55,475
Spare me, I'm not a commie!

1080
01:20:58,725 --> 01:21:01,558
You prick! Damn commie!

1081
01:21:07,058 --> 01:21:08,518
I'm really not a commie!

1082
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:11,600
I'm not even from Gwang-ju. I'm from Seoul.

1083
01:21:11,643 --> 01:21:15,308
# 10-8, Hwayang-dong 384,
Sungdong-go, Seoul.

1084
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:20,350
Yeah.

1085
01:21:21,768 --> 01:21:22,808
I know.

1086
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,518
The Seoul taxi.

1087
01:21:27,268 --> 01:21:30,100
You're that commie who brought
in the German reporter.

1088
01:21:30,475 --> 01:21:33,683
The shit bastard who sold
his country for money!

1089
01:21:35,143 --> 01:21:38,018
And yet you say, "I'm not a commie!"

1090
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:40,350
"I'm not a commie!"

1091
01:21:40,393 --> 01:21:41,975
"I'm not a commie!"

1092
01:21:42,018 --> 01:21:43,893
"I'm not a commie!"

1093
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,725
How dare you...

1094
01:22:10,183 --> 01:22:11,475
We have to get out of here.

1095
01:22:22,143 --> 01:22:24,018
My god, I was so worried!

1096
01:22:24,433 --> 01:22:28,268
I'm glad you made it back.
But where's Jae-sik?

1097
01:22:29,393 --> 01:22:30,808
Wasn't he with you?

1098
01:22:32,143 --> 01:22:33,143
Huh?

1099
01:23:01,143 --> 01:23:02,308
You know...

1100
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:09,350
I earned some money in Saudi Arabia.

1101
01:23:11,933 --> 01:23:15,893
But my wife got sick and I spent
it all on hospital bills.

1102
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:21,225
At the end, my wife insisted
that I buy that taxi.

1103
01:23:23,933 --> 01:23:26,433
And the doctor said so too,

1104
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,893
so I should look after our daughter.

1105
01:23:39,225 --> 01:23:42,518
We could have tried more meds,

1106
01:23:47,433 --> 01:23:51,600
but I didn't argue. That's
the kind of guy I am.

1107
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:56,893
The rest have to go on living, right?

1108
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:05,683
Because after my wife died,
I got drunk every day.

1109
01:24:14,893 --> 01:24:20,100
One day I woke up,

1110
01:24:26,058 --> 01:24:32,183
she was crying holding onto
her mom's old clothes.

1111
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:42,268
She must have missed her so much.

1112
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:53,058
I quit drinking that day.

1113
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,475
I'm the only one she has left.

1114
01:26:10,518 --> 01:26:11,808
What are you doing?

1115
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:17,643
The paratroopers are
searching for a Seoul taxi!

1116
01:26:18,018 --> 01:26:21,100
Should've said you're going.
You don't even know the roads!

1117
01:26:21,518 --> 01:26:24,433
Here, take this and...

1118
01:26:28,393 --> 01:26:33,350
These are hidden roads out of Gwang-ju.

1119
01:26:35,643 --> 01:26:38,808
And the reporter asked me to give you this.

1120
01:26:39,643 --> 01:26:41,725
How can I accept that?

1121
01:26:41,933 --> 01:26:42,933
What?

1122
01:26:43,433 --> 01:26:46,643
If a driver took a passenger,
he should accept the fare!

1123
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,600
Just take it.

1124
01:26:49,393 --> 01:26:51,308
I can't take that money.

1125
01:26:51,393 --> 01:26:54,643
Just the repairs will cost you a lot.

1126
01:26:54,683 --> 01:26:57,058
Don't argue. Just take it!

1127
01:26:59,225 --> 01:27:00,433
On your way, now.

1128
01:27:00,933 --> 01:27:04,058
Your daughter must have
waited all night. Hurry.

1129
01:27:06,683 --> 01:27:09,933
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1130
01:27:13,933 --> 01:27:15,643
Why are you sorry?

1131
01:27:16,143 --> 01:27:18,058
Bastards out there should be.

1132
01:27:27,143 --> 01:27:30,518
It's damn fine weather.

1133
01:27:35,393 --> 01:27:39,433
Come visit with your daughter someday.

1134
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,933
We'll take my son and go on a picnic.

1135
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:46,600
Take care of yourself.

1136
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,558
You take care.

1137
01:28:49,018 --> 01:28:50,933
It'll take an hour to fix it.

1138
01:28:51,433 --> 01:28:53,225
Don't stay cramped in here.

1139
01:28:53,558 --> 01:28:58,018
There's a Buddha's day celebration
or something like that over there.

1140
01:28:58,058 --> 01:28:59,518
Go take a walk around.

1141
01:28:59,725 --> 01:29:00,808
Can I use the phone?

1142
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:16,308
Hello?

1143
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:18,058
Dong-su, is my daughter there?

1144
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,975
Where have you been?

1145
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:21,143
Is she with you?

1146
01:29:21,183 --> 01:29:24,225
She just fell asleep. Wake her up?

1147
01:29:24,268 --> 01:29:26,018
No, let her sleep.

1148
01:29:26,725 --> 01:29:27,975
Is she okay?

1149
01:29:28,518 --> 01:29:31,518
If you're so worried, why did you stay out?

1150
01:29:32,558 --> 01:29:34,225
Did you really get that money?

1151
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,393
Give me the phone.

1152
01:29:36,225 --> 01:29:38,975
Mr. Kim! Where are you?

1153
01:29:39,725 --> 01:29:40,725
I'm...

1154
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:44,558
I'm in the countryside
and my car broke down.

1155
01:29:45,018 --> 01:29:49,308
I left 2,000 won in my drawer.
Please give it to Eunjung...

1156
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:54,058
She's been up all night waiting,
so why make promises!

1157
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,933
Hey, give me the phone!

1158
01:29:56,518 --> 01:30:00,393
You'll be back soon? Let's talk then.
Stop it!

1159
01:30:19,475 --> 01:30:20,475
Hello!

1160
01:30:24,518 --> 01:30:26,018
How old is your daughter?

1161
01:30:26,058 --> 01:30:26,850
Eleven.

1162
01:30:26,893 --> 01:30:29,518
Then how about these?

1163
01:30:29,725 --> 01:30:34,600
These are sturdy and nice. Moms love them.

1164
01:30:34,768 --> 01:30:36,143
They're really popular!

1165
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:42,725
If she's 11, she'll need size 200...

1166
01:30:42,768 --> 01:30:44,308
Give me size 210.

1167
01:30:44,683 --> 01:30:46,600
Size 200 is getting small for her.

1168
01:30:46,643 --> 01:30:51,433
What a thoughtful father.
You know her shoe size!

1169
01:30:52,975 --> 01:30:55,143
Those are a bit expensive...

1170
01:31:01,683 --> 01:31:02,893
A bowl of noodles, please.

1171
01:31:08,183 --> 01:31:10,893
Huh? I thought you went bill collecting?

1172
01:31:10,933 --> 01:31:13,183
Ended up wasting my time.

1173
01:31:13,683 --> 01:31:15,018
Ma'am, another bottle of soju!

1174
01:31:15,058 --> 01:31:15,933
Sure.

1175
01:31:15,975 --> 01:31:18,268
What, people wouldn't pay?

1176
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:20,768
I couldn't even get into Gwang-ju.

1177
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:24,643
I heard people were killed
in Gwang-ju, I guess it's true!

1178
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:26,600
People were killed?

1179
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:31,018
Yeah, soldiers raided the city,
and all hell broke loose.

1180
01:31:31,058 --> 01:31:31,975
What are you talking about?

1181
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:33,393
I don't know for sure,

1182
01:31:33,475 --> 01:31:38,683
but I heard many people were killed,
and a whole bunch arrested.

1183
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:41,018
That's not it.

1184
01:31:41,393 --> 01:31:45,850
A few innocent soldiers were killed in
violent college student protests.

1185
01:31:45,893 --> 01:31:50,393
No, someone really saw
people getting killed there.

1186
01:31:50,433 --> 01:31:52,100
It was in the news.

1187
01:31:52,475 --> 01:31:56,393
Not just students, but hardcore Communists.

1188
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:58,683
They even brought gangsters from Seoul!

1189
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:02,268
Really? It was in the news?

1190
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:04,225
Yeah!

1191
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:07,268
It's in the newspaper
too, a full-page story.

1192
01:32:07,308 --> 01:32:11,808
If they want to protest,
why not just do it in Seoul?

1193
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:14,433
Protests in Gwang-ju
Keeping me from doing my job.

1194
01:32:17,393 --> 01:32:21,143
Rogue Groups and Rioters...

1195
01:32:50,183 --> 01:32:54,975
You must've been really hungry.
Have this, too.

1196
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,808
It's delicious... Delicious.

1197
01:33:16,268 --> 01:33:18,143
Taxi, taxi!

1198
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,518
So pretty.

1199
01:33:28,268 --> 01:33:31,683
Always bought her sneakers,
never a nice pair of shoes...

1200
01:33:32,308 --> 01:33:34,183
Eun-jung will love these.

01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:49,018
What do I do?

1211
01:35:11,018 --> 01:35:12,643
One more phone call, please.

1212
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:16,058
Eun-jung, are you awake?

1213
01:35:16,558 --> 01:35:18,683
Daddy, are we going on a picnic?

1214
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,308
Sorry, there's something I need to do.

1215
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,768
Let's go another time.

1216
01:35:26,225 --> 01:35:27,475
When?

1217
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:33,350
I left a customer behind.

1218
01:35:34,643 --> 01:35:37,433
Someone who really needs to take my taxi.

1219
01:35:38,725 --> 01:35:40,725
I'll come home right after.

1220
01:35:40,768 --> 01:35:44,183
So, be nice and don't fight with Sang-go.

1221
01:35:59,018 --> 01:36:10,058
Until Mt. Baekdu is worn away
and the East Sea's waters run dry,

1222
01:36:10,725 --> 01:36:19,808
God protect and preserve our country.

1223
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:29,475
Where has he gone?

1224
01:36:30,225 --> 01:36:31,308
To the hospital.

1225
01:36:32,558 --> 01:36:33,683
The hospital?

1226
01:37:13,558 --> 01:37:15,058
Why are you back?

1227
01:37:40,558 --> 01:37:43,475
The paratroopers dragged him off,

1228
01:37:46,018 --> 01:37:49,475
and he died on the way.

1229
01:37:51,393 --> 01:37:54,643
So they just threw him in a rice field.

1230
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,475
There aren't enough coffins in Gwang-ju.

1231
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:04,018
So some students went to get more...

1232
01:38:46,143 --> 01:38:47,393
Why are you sitting there?

1233
01:38:50,308 --> 01:38:52,600
You need to record all this.

1234
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:01,768
You promised, to tell people.

1235
01:39:03,058 --> 01:39:07,558
It needs to be broadcast
so people will know.

1236
01:39:09,393 --> 01:39:11,100
You're a reporter, shoot this.

1237
01:39:12,268 --> 01:39:15,225
Jae-sik, and this too.

1238
01:39:16,058 --> 01:39:17,100
Here.

1239
01:40:01,725 --> 01:40:03,350
Open your eyes!

1240
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,725
How can you leave me

1241
01:40:14,143 --> 01:40:16,725
and our unborn baby!

1242
01:40:28,558 --> 01:40:29,893
Make way!

1243
01:40:30,393 --> 01:40:33,058
Over here, Doctor! Please help over here.

1244
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,350
He's been shot.

1245
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,725
Bro, what do we do?

1246
01:40:39,058 --> 01:40:42,725
They're really trying to wipe us all out!

1247
01:40:42,768 --> 01:40:44,808
People were singing the national anthem,

1248
01:40:45,308 --> 01:40:47,808
when the paratroopers
just started shooting.

1249
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:50,143
God, so many people have been shot!

1250
01:40:50,518 --> 01:40:52,518
We need to get there.

1251
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,143
You two go to Seoul, quickly.

1252
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:57,018
I'm coming with you!

1253
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,808
Mr. Kim, you go back to Seoul.
I need to keep filming.

1254
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:01,975
Hey, hey.

1255
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,433
You paid me the fare.

1256
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,350
We go together.

1257
01:41:05,808 --> 01:41:07,058
I taxi driver,

1258
01:41:07,558 --> 01:41:08,933
you taxi customer.

1259
01:41:09,893 --> 01:41:10,893
Okay?

1260
01:41:11,518 --> 01:41:12,808
Okay! Together.

1261
01:41:50,058 --> 01:41:51,808
Dear citizens of Gwang-ju.

1262
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,690
One, stay at home.
Two, don't believe rumors.

1263
01:41:54,518 --> 01:41:55,558
He needs hospital, now!

1264
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,018
Get ahold of yourself!

1265
01:42:06,768 --> 01:42:09,393
Why are they shooting us?

1266
01:42:17,433 --> 01:42:19,225
Don't go out.

1267
01:42:24,475 --> 01:42:25,933
My god, look at that.

1268
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,558
What's going on here?

1269
01:42:33,893 --> 01:42:35,433
Over there! She's shot!

1270
01:43:08,308 --> 01:43:09,725
Get a hold of yourself!

1271
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:36,433
How can they just shoot people?

1272
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,183
How can they do this to us?

1273
01:43:41,475 --> 01:43:43,350
How many times has it been?

1274
01:43:44,183 --> 01:43:46,143
They really plan to kill us all!

1275
01:43:46,183 --> 01:43:49,725
We can't leave injured people like that!

1276
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:55,183
That's it. Let's drive our taxis in.

1277
01:43:56,225 --> 01:43:57,350
Wait...

1278
01:44:02,143 --> 01:44:03,143
Here.

1279
01:44:04,933 --> 01:44:07,893
I can drive well. Let's go together.

1280
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:40,143
Look! The taxi drivers!

1281
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,683
Thank you.

1282
01:45:56,975 --> 01:45:58,100
Young-pyo!

1283
01:45:59,768 --> 01:46:02,018
- Young-pyo!
- Are you okay?

1284
01:46:02,558 --> 01:46:03,725
Hey, duck down.

1285
01:46:03,768 --> 01:46:04,933
Let's help them!

1286
01:46:06,558 --> 01:46:09,225
Let's save the wounded! Come on!

1287
01:46:16,268 --> 01:46:18,725
- Don't lose focus.
- Come here.

1288
01:46:20,725 --> 01:46:21,725
Are you okay?

1289
01:46:22,893 --> 01:46:24,225
Please help me!

1290
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:32,183
Bro, get in here!

1291
01:46:33,518 --> 01:46:34,600
Gently!

1292
01:46:55,308 --> 01:46:57,018
Here, over here!

1293
01:46:57,558 --> 01:46:58,643
Hold on a sec.

1294
01:48:51,808 --> 01:48:53,183
You need to go now.

1295
01:48:53,725 --> 01:48:54,933
They're getting closer.

1296
01:48:54,975 --> 01:48:57,725
You have to go now.
Or it will be impossible.

1297
01:48:58,268 --> 01:49:00,475
Let us take care of this.

1298
01:49:00,975 --> 01:49:05,893
Go back, and please,
prove all their lies wrong!

1299
01:49:05,933 --> 01:49:09,808
We cannot do it, but you can.
Please, for us.

1300
01:49:15,143 --> 01:49:18,018
Go quickly! Things are getting bad here.

1301
01:50:23,768 --> 01:50:25,600
Mr. Kim, we must go now.

1302
01:50:52,433 --> 01:50:53,643
Block all checkpoints.

1303
01:51:10,518 --> 01:51:11,643
Can you get us out?

1304
01:51:14,475 --> 01:51:15,475
Don't worry.

1305
01:51:17,058 --> 01:51:19,268
I'll get you to the airport no matter what.

1306
01:52:07,018 --> 01:52:08,268
Good afternoon.

1307
01:52:09,933 --> 01:52:11,018
Where are you going?

1308
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,268
I'm taking a customer to Seoul.

1309
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:14,433
Is it a Seoul taxi?

1310
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:15,893
No, a Gwang-ju taxi.

1311
01:52:18,225 --> 01:52:19,308
Where's your home?

1312
01:52:20,893 --> 01:52:22,018
Why?

1313
01:52:22,058 --> 01:52:24,100
Answer, you bastard!

1314
01:52:24,933 --> 01:52:26,893
And why don't you have a Gwang-ju accent?

1315
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:30,393
I moved here not long ago.

1316
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:34,225
What's going on? Why are you stopping us?

1317
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:40,850
Hey, college boy! What's
this bastard saying?

1318
01:52:43,558 --> 01:52:44,808
Where are you going?

1319
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:46,893
I'm here on business.

1320
01:52:46,933 --> 01:52:49,975
But it's so dangerous in Gwang-ju,
you know all these riots?

1321
01:52:50,433 --> 01:52:52,268
So we go back to Seoul.

1322
01:52:52,893 --> 01:52:55,100
He came on business but
leaving to escape the riots.

1323
01:53:02,433 --> 01:53:04,143
Both of you, out of the car.

1324
01:53:04,475 --> 01:53:06,768
I don't understand. What's the problem?

1325
01:53:07,768 --> 01:53:08,768
Get out now.

1326
01:53:09,475 --> 01:53:13,100
Being a foreigner won't save you. Get out.

1327
01:53:34,893 --> 01:53:36,100
Open the trunk.

1328
01:54:00,850 --> 01:54:02,933
These are his souvenirs.

1329
01:54:03,183 --> 01:54:04,808
From Buddha's Birthday.

1330
01:54:35,893 --> 01:54:36,893
Let them through.

1331
01:54:39,808 --> 01:54:42,183
Sergeant, we have to stop all foreigners.

1332
01:54:42,225 --> 01:54:44,768
He's not a reporter, and
it's not a Seoul taxi.

1333
01:54:45,725 --> 01:54:46,725
Let them through.

1334
01:54:50,850 --> 01:54:52,225
I said, let them through.

1335
01:54:53,725 --> 01:54:54,725
Yes, sir.

1336
01:55:22,058 --> 01:55:23,933
They said to stop taxis with foreigners!

1337
01:55:23,975 --> 01:55:25,268
Hey, close it!

1338
01:55:34,933 --> 01:55:37,225
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1339
01:55:37,268 --> 01:55:38,683
Plate number 0310.

1340
01:55:39,393 --> 01:55:41,683
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1341
01:55:41,725 --> 01:55:44,475
Plate number 0310.

1342
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,183
This is awesome.

1343
01:57:15,558 --> 01:57:16,641
Run them over.

1344
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:31,391
Bastards!

1345
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,225
Shoot them all!

1346
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:35,850
Damn it!

1347
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,641
Bro, go faster!

1348
01:57:46,933 --> 01:57:48,558
Don't worry about me!

1349
01:58:23,558 --> 01:58:26,058
Come on bastards, let's go at it!

1350
01:58:49,641 --> 01:58:51,183
What's going on back there?

1351
01:59:10,016 --> 01:59:11,350
I'm sorry...

1352
01:59:28,683 --> 01:59:30,225
Take care of yourself!

1353
01:59:30,683 --> 01:59:32,391
Don't worry about us!

1354
02:00:03,183 --> 02:00:04,308
Step on it.

1355
02:00:04,975 --> 02:00:05,975
Step on it!

1356
02:01:52,641 --> 02:01:55,850
Yes, we're searching everywhere.
Don't worry, sir.

1357
02:01:55,891 --> 02:01:58,683
He called the airport just now
and reserved a flight.

1358
02:02:00,266 --> 02:02:01,641
Commander, we found him!

1359
02:02:01,683 --> 02:02:03,933
He booked the 10am plane to Japan tomorrow.

1360
02:02:05,058 --> 02:02:06,433
Yes, sir!

1361
02:02:06,475 --> 02:02:07,475
Hi.

1362
02:02:09,808 --> 02:02:10,766
Mr. Hinzpeter?

1363
02:02:10,808 --> 02:02:11,808
Yes.

1364
02:02:13,558 --> 02:02:17,766
Our system shows that you have a flight
booked for tomorrow at 10am?

1365
02:02:17,808 --> 02:02:19,933
Yes, but I'm somehow here today,

1366
02:02:19,975 --> 02:02:24,933
so I'd like to get onto the first flight
out to Japan and make it first class.

1367
02:03:09,391 --> 02:03:10,391
For your daughter.

1368
02:03:11,516 --> 02:03:12,725
This is for me?

1369
02:03:13,725 --> 02:03:14,725
Thank you.

1370
02:03:15,933 --> 02:03:17,600
Please give me your phone number.

1371
02:03:18,225 --> 02:03:19,141
What?

1372
02:03:19,183 --> 02:03:21,808
Your taxi. I'd like to
pay for all the damage.

1373
02:03:23,141 --> 02:03:26,100
I'll get the news broadcast,
then come right back to Korea.

1374
02:03:26,683 --> 02:03:28,308
I'll call you when I return.

1375
02:03:32,808 --> 02:03:34,891
Ah, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

1376
02:03:37,141 --> 02:03:38,141
Please.

1377
02:03:48,933 --> 02:03:50,433
Sa-Bok Cigarettes

1378
02:03:54,975 --> 02:03:55,975
Here you are.

1379
02:04:06,641 --> 02:04:08,058
Hey, stop that!

1380
02:04:12,350 --> 02:04:13,391
You're a good man.

1381
02:04:14,891 --> 02:04:15,975
You did a good job.

1382
02:04:22,808 --> 02:04:25,225
You... you good job too.

1383
02:04:27,391 --> 02:04:30,100
Learn Korean, before you come next time.

1384
02:04:31,100 --> 02:04:33,683
Come back, speak Korean, okay?

1385
02:04:34,891 --> 02:04:35,891
Okay.

1386
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,100
Go on.

1387
02:05:43,141 --> 02:05:44,683
The curfew starts soon.

1388
02:05:45,016 --> 02:05:48,141
Did your dad run off? Cause he's so poor?

1389
02:05:50,183 --> 02:05:53,350
Sang-go! Stop bothering your friend!

1390
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:56,516
But she hit me first!

1391
02:05:56,558 --> 02:05:58,308
How'd you end up that way?

1392
02:05:59,058 --> 02:06:01,683
Eun-jung, come have some fruit. Get in!

1393
02:06:35,766 --> 02:06:36,850
Daddy!

1394
02:06:39,808 --> 02:06:40,808
Eun-jung.

1395
02:06:50,641 --> 02:06:52,058
I'm sorry.

1396
02:06:52,975 --> 02:06:54,683
You waited so long...

1397
02:06:56,433 --> 02:06:59,558
Daddy, why are you crying?

1398
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:07,683
Daddy...

1399
02:07:08,433 --> 02:07:13,933
There's still no end in sight
to the democratic uprising

1400
02:07:13,975 --> 02:07:16,225
in the Korean city of Gwang-ju.

1401
02:07:16,266 --> 02:07:21,016
From looking at the wounded,

1402
02:07:21,058 --> 02:07:27,808
we can witness the violence done
to protesters in the last two days.

1403
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:33,766
The army has blockaded the city
and cut off all telephone and telex.

1404
02:07:34,725 --> 02:07:38,475
According to military
sources, as of Wednesday,

1405
02:07:38,516 --> 02:07:41,808
there have been 9 deaths and
about 60 people were injured.

1406
02:07:41,850 --> 02:07:45,225
However, students and protesters
mention much higher figures,

1407
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:49,975
Are you sure you searched everywhere?

1408
02:07:50,266 --> 02:07:54,933
Yes, but there's no taxi
driver with this name.

1409
02:07:57,391 --> 02:07:59,100
Kim Sa-bok

1410
02:08:00,183 --> 02:08:02,058
So even the number is wrong.

1411
02:08:03,141 --> 02:08:05,350
Kim Sa-bok may not be his real name.

1412
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:10,183
It might be better not to look for him.

1413
02:08:28,766 --> 02:08:31,016
Dec-03

1414
02:08:47,183 --> 02:08:51,933
It is a great honor for me to
receive this award here in Korea.

1415
02:08:52,933 --> 02:08:57,016
I still remember the faces of
the citizens I met in Gwang-ju,

1416
02:08:57,725 --> 02:09:00,350
that spring of 1980.

1417
02:09:02,683 --> 02:09:04,641
And I will never forget.

1418
02:09:08,683 --> 02:09:13,683
But there is one face
in particular that I miss dearly.

1419
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:18,933
My brave friend, Kim Sa-bok.

1420
02:09:20,975 --> 02:09:22,225
He is a taxi driver.

1421
02:09:28,725 --> 02:09:29,933
Hey.

1422
02:09:29,975 --> 02:09:31,183
Hey, young man!

1423
02:09:31,725 --> 02:09:34,016
Sorry, sir. I only have 10,000 won.

1424
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:36,100
That's fine. Go on.

1425
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:39,350
Thank you!

1426
02:09:39,391 --> 02:09:40,641
Watch your step.

1427
02:09:51,475 --> 02:09:53,308
Hey, wait!

1428
02:09:53,683 --> 02:09:57,308
Without him, news of the Gwang-ju Uprising

1429
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:58,409
would have never reached the world.

1430
02:09:58,433 --> 02:09:59,516
Oh my.

1431
02:10:01,183 --> 02:10:04,433
I'm afraid my words fail
to express my gratitude,

1432
02:10:04,891 --> 02:10:07,016
but you're always in my thoughts.

1433
02:10:07,058 --> 02:10:10,725
Mr. Kim, my dear friend.

1434
02:10:12,683 --> 02:10:13,683
Thank you.

1435
02:10:15,308 --> 02:10:16,766
I've missed you.

1436
02:10:21,933 --> 02:10:23,391
I'll keep waiting.

1437
02:10:25,141 --> 02:10:27,766
I hope to see you again soon.

1438
02:10:31,891 --> 02:10:35,391
He said if not for Kim Sa-bok's help
he could never have made the report,

1439
02:10:35,433 --> 02:10:37,183
and he wishes to see him again.

1440
02:10:37,225 --> 02:10:39,141
I'm more grateful to you.

1441
02:10:40,891 --> 02:10:42,433
Thank you, thank you.

1442
02:10:43,308 --> 02:10:45,433
I wanted to see you again, too.

1443
02:10:47,016 --> 02:10:48,641
At least I see you like this.

1444
02:10:49,558 --> 02:10:52,558
You've grown old too.

1445
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:12,183
Hello, where to?

1446
02:11:12,225 --> 02:11:13,725
To Gwanghwamun, please.

1447
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:16,433
Gwanghwamun, okay.

1448
02:12:19,058 --> 02:12:23,850
It would be truly wonderful
if I could meet you again.

1449
02:12:29,266 --> 02:12:33,850
Oh... really, I'd be happy beyond words.

1450
02:12:43,641 --> 02:12:50,558
If I could find you through this footage,

1451
02:12:51,808 --> 02:12:56,100
and then meet you once again,

1452
02:12:57,475 --> 02:13:00,516
I would just be so happy.

1453
02:13:00,683 --> 02:13:06,100
I'd rush over to Seoul in an instant,

1454
02:13:06,391 --> 02:13:15,475
ride with you in your taxi,
and see the new Korea.
